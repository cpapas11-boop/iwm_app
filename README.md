# Waste Management App (local port)

This is a minimal Vite + React (TypeScript) scaffold that uses the existing `full_version.tsx` as the app entry.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd "${PWD}" # open the project folder
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The app uses `jspdf` and `lucide-react` which are listed in `package.json`.
- Styling in the original component used Tailwind classes; this scaffold provides minimal CSS so it renders acceptably. For full styles, install and configure Tailwind or adjust the component styles.
